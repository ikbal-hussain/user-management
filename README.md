# User Management Dashboard

This is a simple **React.js** application for managing users. It allows you to:
- Fetch and display a list of users.
- Add new users via a form.
- Edit and delete users (basic UI functionality; implementation can be extended).

## Features
1. **Fetch Users**: Users are fetched from an external API (`https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users`) and displayed as cards.
2. **Add Users**: Add a new user with a name, email, and department.
3. **Edit and Delete Buttons**: Buttons are available for editing and deleting users, but their functionality is currently limited to console logs.
4. **Form Validation**: Input fields are cleared after successfully adding a user.
